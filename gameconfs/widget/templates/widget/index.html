    <h1>The Gameconfs Widget</h1>
    <p>You can add Gameconfs to your own website as a widget. It looks like this:</p>
    <div id="gameconfs-widget-container" data-nr-months="3" data-place="Europe" data-width="240" data-height="400"></div>
    <script src="{{ url_for('widget.script', _external=True, version='1') }}" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <br/>
    <h2>How to add it to a WordPress blog</h2>
    <p>Just go to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/gameconfs-widget/" target="_blank">plugin page in the official WordPress plugin directory</a> and follow the instructions there.</p>
    <h2>How to add it to any website</h2>
    <p>The widget is easy to integrate. You just need to add two lines to your website's HTML. First, put:</p>
    <pre>&lt;div id="gameconfs-widget-container" data-nr-months="3" data-place="Europe" data-width="240" data-height="400"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
    <p>where you want the widget to appear. You may want to change some of those parameters; this is explained below. Then, put:</p>
    <pre>&lt;script src="http://www.gameconfs.com/widget/v1/script.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
    <p>after that div, for instance at the end of your &lt;body&gt; tag.</p>
    <h3>Parameters</h3>
    <p>You can customize the widget by changing the parameters of the div. The parameters are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>data-nr-months</strong>: The number of months from today you want to see in the widget. The value has to be between 1 and 12. Optional. The default is 3.</li>
        <li><strong>data-place</strong>: The continent, country, state or city you want to show events for. Optional. The default is to leave this parameter out, which shows events in the whole world.</li>
        <li><strong>data-width</strong>: The width of the widget in pixels. Optional. The default is 240.</li>
        <li><strong>data-height</strong>: The height of the widget in pixels. Optional. The default is 400.</li>
        <li><strong>data-no-css</strong>: Set this to true if you don't want the widget to inject CSS. Optional. See below.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you tell the widget not to inject CSS, all the styling is entirely up to you. This is an option for advanced users.</p>
    <h2>How to add it to a Wordpress blog</h2>
    <p>Download the <a href="{{ url_for('widget.static', filename='dl/gameconfs-widget.php') }}">Wordpress widget</a>, put it in your wp-content/plugins directory, and install it using your Wordpress administration interface. You can set all of the widget's parameters there.</p>
    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <p>Here are the answers to some questions you might have:</p>
    <p><strong>How stable is this widget?</strong></p>
    <p>I've had this running on my own blog since May 2013, and I've not had any problems with it.</p>
    <p><strong>Can your widget damage my site?</strong></p>
    <p>I don't see how: it injects some HTML and CSS into the page. The worse case I can imagine is it makes your site look odd. But I make no guarantees.</p>
    <p><strong>How does the widget work?</strong></p>
    <p>The script uses jQuery to insert its own CSS into your page and to load some HTML from the Gameconfs server (using JSONP). It tries to play nice with your Javascript, jQuery and CSS.</p>
    <p><strong>Do you take feature requests?</strong></p>
    <p>Within reason, sure. I want this widget to be useful. Just <a href="mailto:admin@gameconfs.com">email me</a> and I'll see what I can do.</p>
