    <h1>The Gameconfs Widget</h1>
    <p>You can add Gameconfs to your own website as a widget. It looks like this:</p>
    <div id="gameconfs-widget-container" data-nr-months="3" data-place="Europe" data-width="240" data-height="400"></div>
    <script src="{{ url_for('widget.script', _external=True, version='1') }}" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <br/>
    <h2>How to add it to a WordPress blog</h2>
    <p>Just go to the 'Plugins / Add New' menu in the administration interface of your WordPress installation and search for Gameconfs.</p>
    <p>If you want to install it manually, go to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/gameconfs-widget/" target="_blank">plugin page in the official WordPress plugin directory</a> and follow the instructions there.</p>
    <p>Once installed, you can add the widget to your blog and change its parameters in the 'Appearance' / 'Widgets' menu.</p>
    <h2>How to add it to any website</h2>
    <p>The widget is easy to integrate. You just need to add two lines to your website's HTML. First, put:</p>
    <pre>&lt;div id="gameconfs-widget-container" data-nr-months="3" data-place="Europe" data-width="240" data-height="400"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
    <p>where you want the widget to appear. You may want to change some of those parameters; this is explained below. Then, put:</p>
    <pre>&lt;script src="http://www.gameconfs.com/widget/v1/script.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
    <p>after that div, for instance at the end of your &lt;body&gt; tag.</p>
    <h3>Parameters</h3>
    <p>You can customize the widget by changing the parameters of the div. The parameters are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>data-nr-months</strong>: The number of months from today you want to see in the widget. The value has to be between 1 and 12. Optional. The default is 3.</li>
        <li><strong>data-place</strong>: The continent, country, state or city you want to show events for. Optional. The default is to leave this parameter out, which shows events in the whole world.</li>
        <li><strong>data-width</strong>: The width of the widget in pixels. Optional. The default is 240.</li>
        <li><strong>data-height</strong>: The height of the widget in pixels. Optional. The default is 400.</li>
        <li><strong>data-no-css</strong>: Set this to true if you don't want the widget to use its own CSS. Optional. See below.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you tell the widget not to use its own CSS, all the styling is entirely up to you. This is an option for advanced users.</p>
    <h2>Customizing CSS</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips to help you customize the style of the widget if you've decided to not use the widget's own CSS:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The widget is in a div with the ID 'gameconfs-widget-container'.</li>
      <li>The widget mainly uses h2 and h3 elements, and tables for the event data.</li>
      <li>You can use <a href="http://www.gameconfs.com/widget/v1/widget.css" target="_blank">the widget's existing CSS</a> for inspiration.
        You can probably ignore the first section, which was copied from Bootstrap.
        You can also ignore the heavy use of !important: that's just to make sure the widget's CSS overrides that of the site it's embedded into.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <p>Here are the answers to some questions you might have:</p>
    <p><strong>How stable is this widget?</strong></p>
    <p>I've had this running on my own blog since May 2013, and I've not had any problems with it.</p>
    <p><strong>Can your widget damage my site?</strong></p>
    <p>I don't see how: it injects some HTML and CSS into the page. The worse case I can imagine is it makes your site look odd. But I make no guarantees.</p>
    <p><strong>How does the widget work?</strong></p>
    <p>The script uses jQuery to insert its own CSS into your page and to load some HTML from the Gameconfs server (using JSONP). It tries to play nice with your Javascript, jQuery and CSS.</p>
    <p><strong>Do you take feature requests?</strong></p>
    <p>Within reason, sure. I want this widget to be useful. Just <a href="mailto:admin@gameconfs.com">email me</a> and I'll see what I can do.</p>
